# About Me
Hi! I'm Vina, a professional civil engineer who made the leap into data analytics. As a civil engineer, I'm used to looking at data and analyzing it to obtain new projects or contracts. I'm self-managed and passionate professional with strong communication and analytical skills.

Data Analysis is a "new" field of study but very important in all aspects of life - whether in engineering, health care, climate change, etc. It is a very challenging field that I enjoy as I liked problem solving since I was very little - it is what got me into engineering in the first place.  

Thank you for taking the time to visit my page and I hope to hear from you soon!
