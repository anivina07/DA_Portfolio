# About Me
Hi! I'm Vina, a professional civil engineer who made the leap into data analytics. As a civil engineer, I'm used to looking at data and analyzing it to obtain new projects or contracts. I'm self-managed and passionate professional with strong communication and analytical skills.

Data Analysis is a "new" field of study but very important in all aspects of life - whether in engineering, health care, climate change, etc. It is a very challenging field that I enjoy as I liked problem solving since I was very little - it is what got me into engineering in the first place.  

Thank you for taking the time to visit my page and I hope to hear from you soon!

### Overview

A look into client disputes for the company Yellevate, which specializes in providing marketing services to other companies. Services which include launching their marketing operations such as email marketing, website development, content creation and others.  For the past few years, Yellevate has been struggling with client disputes, which is clients expressing their dissatisfaction with the companyâ€™s services and refusing to pay them. This has led to an approximate 5% annual loss of revenue (in USD) as nearly 20% of disputes raised against Yellevate resulted in a payment optout.
